This step of the process was some exploratory analysis of the provided dataset to understand what's in it, and to make decisions on what to do with each field (sometimes by getting a feel of how much work would be needed).

The notebooks haven't been prepped for presentation, but the tidiest would be the [exploratory_analysis notebook](exploratory_analysis.ipynb).
