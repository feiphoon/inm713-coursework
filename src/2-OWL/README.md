# 2 - Task OWL (Ontology Modelling)

In this folder I have different versions of the ontology I created.

The most up-to-date ontology in use for the rest of the project is [pizza_restaurant_ontology8.ttl](pizza_restaurant_ontology8.ttl).

The most up-to-date ontology mentioned in Further Improvements in the report is: [pizza_restaurant_ontology9.ttl](pizza_restaurant_ontology9.ttl).

Both can be opened and viewed in Protégé.
